## Setting up in IntelliJ

**Prerequisites:** JDK 17, and the latest version of IntelliJ.  

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not on the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the current project).  
2. Import the project into IntelliJ:  
   1. Click **Open**.  
   2. Select the project directory, then click **OK**.  
   3. Accept defaults for any further prompts.  
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in the [official guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).  
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to `SDK default`.  
4. Locate the file `src/main/java/Kenma.java`, right-click it, and choose `Run Kenma.main()`.  
   If the setup is correct, you should see:  

```java
