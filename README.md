“Kenma iP: making task management simple and fun!” – Anonymous

Kenma iP is a Java project template based on the Duke skeleton that helps you quickly get started with Java project development.

It is:

text-based

easy to learn

boring SUPER FAST 🚀

All you need to do is:

Download the project.

Open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

Run Kenma.main().

Add your tasks and let it manage them for you 😉

Setting up in IntelliJ

Prerequisites: JDK 17, and the latest version of IntelliJ.

Open IntelliJ (if you are not on the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the current project).

Import the project into IntelliJ:

Click Open.

Select the project directory, then click OK.

Accept defaults for any further prompts.

Configure the project to use JDK 17 (not any other version), as explained in the official guide
.
In the same dialog, set the Project language level field to SDK default.

Locate the file src/main/java/Kenma.java, right-click it, and choose Run Kenma.main().
If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following output:

Hello from
 ____        _        
|  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|


Warning: Keep the src/main/java folder as the root folder for Java source files. Don’t rename or move these folders, as tools like Gradle expect this path by default.
